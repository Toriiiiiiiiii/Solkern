# Solkern
***Minimal Monolithic Kernel***

## Introduction
Hello, World! This is a project that I have decided to create after being reminded of my
past attempts. In the past, I made extensive use of YouTube tutorials, meaning that none
of the code was my own. In this project, I aim to create a kernel using nothing but the 
OSDev wiki and any other resources (such as similar projects on GitHub).

## Project Goals
- [ ] Integrated Shell
- [ ] Filesystem support
- [ ] Custom System Programming Language
